# TicTacToe
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. Players take turns marking their respective symbols (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If the grid is filled without a winner, the game is a draw. Â
